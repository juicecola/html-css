Google Search Front-End Project
Introduction
This project involves designing a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The primary goal is to create a user interface that interacts with Google's search functionalities by constructing proper GET requests.

Background
The project is based on the idea of constructing a form that sends data to an existing web server, in this case, Google's. The basic structure has already been provided, demonstrating a simple Google Search form. The form utilizes a query string in the URL to submit information to Google.

Getting Started
Download the distribution code from search.zip and unzip it.
Alternatively, manually create the index.html file as described in the "Background" section.
Specification
Your website should meet the following requirements:

Three pages: index.html for regular Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
Links in the upper-right to navigate between pages.
Centered search bar with rounded corners and centered search button on the Google Search page.
Google Image Search allows users to type a query, click search, and view results.
Google Advanced Search allows users to input search criteria and navigate to search results.
Consistent styling with Google's own aesthetics.
"I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page that takes users directly to the first search result.
